# FlaskGen
A Python CLI tool that generates a Flask project template with optional Bootstrap setup, Dockerfile, .env, and GitHub Actions.

This project saves time setting up a Flask project which could be better utilized in actually building an app :)

## How to setup

#### Install as a system-wide tool
```git clone https://github.com/actuallyarnav/flaskgen```

```cd flaskgen```

```pipx install .```
